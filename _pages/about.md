Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a dedicated Computer Science professional currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at NYU’s Courant Institute, maintaining a 3.9 GPA. I hold a Bachelor’s degree from PES University, India. I am actively seeking full-time roles in machine learning and artificial intelligence and software development. 

With over five years of industry experience, I have specialized in full-stack development, focusing on building cloud platforms, enterprise application models, and developer tools. At SAP Labs, I architected and implemented a server-driven user interface system that completely automated the frontend development. I also managed timelines and coordination with international teams to ensure smooth execution and delivery.

During my tenure at Oracle, I concentrated on database and cloud development. I was part of the launch of MicroTx, a cloud-native solution ensuring robust data consistency across polyglot microservices via distributed transactions. Additionally, I re-engineered the Oracle Blockchain Platform from an on-premise virtual machine architecture to a modern cloud-based Kubernetes architecture, focusing on critical security, networking, and deployment components. I also worked on CI/CD pipelines. 

Currently, I am deeply engaged in advanced AI coursework at NYU, covering topics such as Deep Learning, LLMs and Computer Vision. My curiosity for AI drives me to explore its potential to innovate and solve complex problems. 

Throughout my career, I have prioritized delivering clean, well-structured code, meeting deadlines consistently, and fostering effective collaboration.
